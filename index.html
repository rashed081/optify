            Krulitz had a vision for improving leadership development through adigital platform that connected clients
            with the coaches and materials they need to realize their potential.
            When next steps were unclear, Pam approached Viget about forming a strategic partnership that would help
            bring her brainchild to life. We worked closely with Pam from the beginning to produce a clickable prototype
            that made her idea tangible to prospective clients, and a brand strategy that articulated her vision and
            gave her product the name “Optify.” We continued our partnership with Pam by creating a product strategy
            that informed the design and build of the coaching platform. Optify was created the same way that strong
            leaders are developed -- together in a partnership at the intersection of passion and perspective.

                Pam needed something tangible that she could present to potential clients — something that would show
                how her concept would look in real life. We started with a two-week sprint, during which we translated
                Pam’s vision into a clickable prototype. We focused on core features, each defined through close
                collaboration. By the end of the process, Pam was able to demo her idea to prospective customers,
                validating that the concept was worth developing into a real product.

                Creating a brand strategy for Pam allowed us to dig down to the core of her mission — to articulate the
                truth about what her product is, what it does, and why. We held a workshop with Pam and her
                stakeholders, during which we identified brand attributes and defined problems and goals. This served as
                the foundation for our strategy concept: demystifying leadership development. The strategy communicated
                Pam’s vision to make personalized coaching and practical training resources accessible to those outside
                the C-Suite. It also inspired her name, Optify, and accompanying visual identity.

            <p>
                By the time we were ready to design and develop a minimum viable product (MVP), we had a deep
                understanding of Pam’s vision and how to articulate it. Now, the question was: out of the dozens of
                features that we could build, which ones should we create? What did potential users need, and what could
                we create that would set Optify apart? And how could we set Optify on a course to realize their
                long-term business goals, while remaining agile and adaptable? Achieving this meant developing a robust
                product strategy. During this phase, we conducted stakeholder interviews and product opportunity
                assessments, competitive analysis, and user research.

        <div class="div2">
            <p>
                When we started developing the MVP for Optify, our goal was simple: we wanted to equip them with
                software that would allow for sophisticated functionality, and would provide a strong foundation for
                growth. With this in mind, we decided to use Elixir, paired with Phoenix as the framework. This allowed
                us to make use of websockets for real-time collaboration in the platform’s messaging feature. Now, after
                a successful product launch with a growing user base, the combination of Elixir and Phoenix ensures
                Optify can grow quickly without worrying about a lengthy, expensive code re-write.
